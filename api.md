# Simple request API 
## Packages
to do 
## Servives

For showing goods from server side ther is simple API that filters list of records according with category, colour, price: 
```
/api/:sector/:size
```
the url consists of constant part (/api) and varibales (sector - vip or regular, size - the size of product ).
The REST api is not a full-fledged  CRUD tool. It has no tools for inserting, updating, deleting data. There is only ability to select them. Changing of database can be  carried out as editing of JSON file.
